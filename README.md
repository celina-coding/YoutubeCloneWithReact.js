# YouTube Clone

A full-stack YouTube clone application I built to challenge myself with more complex React development and backend integration using Firebase.

## Project Overview

This project replicates core YouTube functionality, allowing users to watch videos, interact with content, and manage their own channels in a familiar interface.

**Key Features:**
- Video upload and streaming
- User authentication and profiles  
- Like/dislike system and comments
- Responsive video player
- Real-time comment updates

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React, JavaScript (ES6+), CSS3
- **Backend:** Firebase (Firestore, Authentication, Storage)

## Technical Implementation

**Authentication System:**
- Firebase Auth for user registration/login
- Protected routes for authenticated users
- User profile management


## Challenges Overcome
- Managing large video file uploads and storage
- Creating a responsive video player interface
- Handling user authentication across different components
- Optimizing database queries for better performance

## What I Learned
This project was a significant step up in complexity from my earlier work. It taught me how to integrate frontend React applications with backend services, handle file uploads, and create more sophisticated user authentication systems. Working with Firebase gave me valuable experience with NoSQL databases and cloud services.

The project really pushed my understanding of React state management, component lifecycle, and how to structure larger applications with multiple interconnected features.
